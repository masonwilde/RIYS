# Run It Yourself Software

## TL;DR

A suite of simple html/js webpages that perform some basic tasks.

## Inspiration

I've had a number of times where I've wanted to do something "simple" but the only online tools want a subscription or fee to run on some server somewhere. I wanted to make a suite of tools that could be run locally on a computer without needing to be connected to the internet, but would also be web based so that they could be run on any device with a modern browser.

## Tools I plan on implementing.
* String Manipulation
* Video Viewer/Editor
* Image Viewer/Editor
* Audio Viewer/Editor
* Maps Viewer
